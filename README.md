Data is based on 4 files for the assignment:
1. **all_search_events**: Contains records of search events
2. **view_listing_detail_events**: Contains records of when listings are clicked from the search screen
3. **reservations**: Contains records of booking requests and payments
4. **amplitude_user_ids**: A foreign key table for user IDs

Data was loaded into databricks and then cleansed using notebooks.  I used a combination of both python and SQL to cleanse the data.
Analysis was done in the Analysis notebook.  All queries were ran and the results should show up in the notebook.
I wrote up my findings (with screenshots) in a word document named Analysis.
